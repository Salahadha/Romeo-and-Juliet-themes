<h2 class="h2theme">What is a theme </h2> 

<br>
<div class="div3"> 
<p>A theme in literature is a central idea or underlying message that a work explores about <br>
     human nature, society, or life. Unlike a simple subject ( "love" or "war"), a theme is a <br>
      complete thought or insight the text conveys, such as "Love often requires sacrifice" or  <br>
       "Pride leads to destruction." Themes are not explicitly stated but are revealed through characters <br>
       ' actions, conflicts, symbols, and key events. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, the recurring motifs  <br>
       of light and darkness develop themes like "Passionate love can defy social hatred but at a tragic cost." <br>
       Themes resonate universally, inviting readers to reflect on deeper truths beyond the plot.</p>

<h1 class="h111">üé≠ Major Themes in Romeo and Juliet</h1>

<div class="types4">
<h2>1. Love vs. Hate</h2> <br> <br>

Message: Passionate love can defy societal hatred, but not without consequences. <br> <br>
Evidence: The lovers‚Äô secret marriage contrasts with the feud (Act 2, Scene 2: "My only love sprung from my only hate!"). <br><br>

<h2>2. Fate vs. Free Will</h2> <br><br>

Message: Are the lovers doomed by destiny ("star-cross‚Äôd" Prologue), or do their choices cause tragedy? <br><br>
Evidence: Romeo defies fate ("I defy you, stars!" Act 5, Scene 1) but still dies. <br> br\

<h2>3. The Individual vs. Society</h2> <br><br>

Message: Family, religion, and gender norms trap the lovers. <br><br>
Evidence: Juliet rebels ("Deny thy father and refuse thy name!" Act 2, Scene 2). <br><br>

<h2>4. The Passage from Youth to Adulthood</h2> <br><br>

Message: Rash decisions lead to loss of innocence. <br><br>
Evidence: Juliet‚Äôs evolution from obedient girl to defiant woman (Act 3, Scene 5: "I‚Äôll not wed Paris!"). <br> <br>
